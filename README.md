# Rolling two dice

For this exercise, I want you to reproduce the code you wrote for that previous exercise.  __I then want you to complete an additional function called `n_uniform_discrete`__.  This function takes three arguments `n`, `a` and `b`.  It should return one number.  The returned number should be the sum of `n` uniform discrete random variables.   The random variables that you sum should be greater than or equal to `a` and less than or equal to `b`.

The function you have written can be used to model what happens when we roll two fair dice and take the sum as we would in a game such as Monopoly.  To demonstrate how this would work I have written a line to print out what you would get if you rolled the two dice four times.
